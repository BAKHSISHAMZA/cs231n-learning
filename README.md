# 🧠 CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository documents my **complete learning journey through Stanford’s CS231n course**, focusing on mastering the core principles of computer vision and deep learning through theory, implementation, and experiments.

## 🎯 Intent & Philosophy

> *"You don’t truly understand a concept until you can implement it from scratch."*

My goal in this repo is not just to watch lectures — but to **rebuild every core idea**:
- Implement algorithms (kNN, SVM, Softmax, CNNs, Backpropagation, etc.) from scratch in NumPy/PyTorch  
- Write **clean, modular code** as if preparing for production  
- Document every step (math, intuition, and design choices)  
- Create a resource I can **reference and show to future employers/clients**

## 🧠 Reflections

> Learning deep learning is not about speed — it’s about depth.  
> Every implementation is a step toward true intuition.
